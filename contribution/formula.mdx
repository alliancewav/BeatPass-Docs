title: "Contribution Formula"
description: "How BeatPass calculates your contribution value and distributes earnings fairly."

## Overview

The contribution formula determines how platform revenue is distributed among producers. Instead of a fixed per-play rate, your share is calculated based on multiple engagement signals that reflect genuine value.

<Info>
  **Audience:** Producers
</Info>

## How It Works

### The Contribution Pool

Each month, a portion of platform subscription revenue forms the **contribution pool**. This pool is distributed to producers based on their **contribution value** relative to all producers.

```
Your Payout = (Your Contribution Value / Total Contribution Value) × Pool Amount
```

---

## Input Signals

Your contribution value is calculated from multiple engagement metrics:

### Primary Signals

| Signal | Description | Weight |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Plays | Total streams of your tracks | High |
| Completions | Plays reaching 80%+ duration | Higher |
| Saves | Users adding to their library | Medium |

### Quality Signals

| Signal | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Completion Rate | % of plays that complete | Positive |
| Skip Rate | % of plays skipped early | Negative |
| Repeat Listens | Same user plays again | Positive |

<Tip>
  Completions are weighted significantly higher than partial plays. A track with fewer plays but high completions may earn more than a track with many plays but frequent skips.
</Tip>

## Fairness Mechanisms

### Why Not Just Plays?

A simple per-play model creates problems:

- Encourages short, skippable tracks
- Rewards artificial inflation
- Doesn't reflect genuine engagement

### Our Approach

The formula is designed to:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Reward Quality">
    Tracks that listeners enjoy and complete earn more than those frequently skipped.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Prevent Gaming">
    Signals are normalized and capped to limit artificial manipulation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Support Diverse Content">
    Different track lengths and styles can succeed based on genuine engagement.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Maintain Transparency">
    Producers can see their metrics and understand their earnings.
  </Accordion>

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High Quality, Moderate Plays

> **Track A**: 500 plays, 85% completion rate, 50 saves  
> **Result**: Strong contribution value due to high engagement quality

### Scenario 2: High Plays, Low Quality

> **Track B**: 2,000 plays, 30% completion rate, 10 saves  
> **Result**: Lower contribution value despite higher play count due to poor engagement

### Scenario 3: Balanced Performance

> **Track C**: 1,000 plays, 60% completion rate, 100 saves  
> **Result**: Good contribution value from balanced engagement signals

<Note>
  These are illustrative examples. Exact calculations depend on many factors including the overall pool and total platform engagement.

## Calculation Timing

### When Values Update

| Event | Timing |
|-------|--------|
| Play recorded | Near real-time |
| Contribution calculated | Hourly aggregation |
| Monthly total | End of calendar month |
| Payout processed | First week of following month |
