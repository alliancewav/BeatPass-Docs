# Beat Placement Detection

## Summary

BeatPass now automatically detects when your beats are used in songs released on Spotify, YouTube, and Deezer. Powered by <Tooltip tip="BeatPass's audio fingerprinting technology that creates a unique digital signature of your beat's audio waveform.">BeatPassID</Tooltip> fingerprinting, this feature scans streaming catalogs monthly and notifies you with full song details, streaming links, and a confidence score — so you always know where your beats end up.

---

## What's New

- **Automatic beat scanning** — Your uploaded beats are compared against millions of songs on Spotify, YouTube, and Deezer each month
- **Heard In section** — A new producer-only section on your track page shows all detected placements with song title, artist, confidence score, and streaming links
- **Placement notifications** — Receive in-app and email notifications when a new placement is detected, with direct links to listen and verify
- **Verification guidance** — Each notification includes instructions to confirm whether the placement is a licensed use, and how to contact support if it isn't
- **Collaborative beat support** — For beats with multiple credited producers, only one needs a verified profile for the beat to be scanned. All credited producers with accounts are notified
- **Notification preferences** — Control placement notifications from your [notification preferences](https://open.beatpass.ca/notifications/settings) under the **Beat Placement Detection** group

---

## Why It Matters

- **Protect your work** — Know when your beats appear in released music, whether or not it was licensed through BeatPass
- **Verify licensing** — Cross-reference placements with your download notifications and license certificates to confirm authorized use
- **Take action on unauthorized use** — If a placement doesn't have a valid license, BeatPass support can help you with next steps
- **Zero effort** — Scans run automatically each month. No setup, no manual checking

## Bug Fixes

### Stripe Connect Onboarding Popup

Fixed a bug where the **Connect Your Payment Account** popup was appearing for regular users who do not have a producer (artist) profile. The popup — and the underlying API call to check Stripe Connect status — now only triggers for users who:

1. **Have a linked artist profile** on BeatPass
2. **Have not yet completed** Stripe Connect onboarding (account not connected, or charges/payouts not enabled)

Previously, the popup would fire for every logged-in user, causing repeated `404` errors on the `/artist/stripe-connect/status` endpoint for non-producer accounts. This is now fully gated behind an artist profile check at three independent layers: the API query, the modal timer, and the render guard.

<Info>If you are a regular listener or subscriber without a producer profile, you will never see this popup. Producers who have already connected their Stripe account will also not see it.</Info>
