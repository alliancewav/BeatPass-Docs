# Beat Request Overhaul & Platform Polish

## Summary

A comprehensive audit and upgrade of the Beat Request system alongside platform-wide visual consistency improvements, a critical pricing page fix, and dozens of code quality enhancements across the Producer Dashboard, library, player, and analytics.

---

## What's New

### Feed Redesign

- **"All" and "My Requests" tabs** — Switch between the public feed and your own requests in one click
- **Genre filter** — Narrow the feed to requests matching your style
- **Sort options** — Sort by newest, expiring soon, most submissions, or budget
- **Expired requests hidden** — The "All" tab now shows only active requests, reducing clutter
- **Relative timestamps** — See when a request was posted (e.g., "5m ago", "2h ago") alongside the expiry countdown

### Submission Improvements (Producers)

- **Multi-track selection** — Select and submit multiple tracks at once instead of one at a time
- **5-track submission limit** — Each producer can submit up to 5 tracks per request
- **Already-submitted marking** — Tracks you've already sent are visually flagged so you won't pick duplicates
- **Duplicate audio detection** — Tracks matching an existing submission's audio fingerprint are automatically blocked
- **Platform-hosted requirement** — Only tracks uploaded to BeatPass (not external links) can be submitted
- **Fingerprint verification** — Tracks must have a completed audio fingerprint before submission
- **Upload via Backstage** — The "Upload New Track" option now opens your Backstage in a new tab for a smoother upload workflow

### Request Creation

- **Budget currency selector** — Choose from USD, EUR, GBP, or CAD when setting a budget
- **Genre stored as display name** — Genre labels now appear exactly as shown in the platform

### Token System Fixes

- **Multi-token refunds** — Deleting a 48h or 72h request now correctly refunds 2 or 3 tokens (previously always refunded 1)
- **Accurate usage tracking** — Token usage now sums actual token amounts instead of counting transaction rows, preventing over-limit submissions
- **Plan upgrade token refresh** — Upgrading your plan now correctly resets your token balance to the new plan's limit immediately
- **Rollback safety** — If request creation fails partway through, the full token cost is returned (not just 1 token)

### Renewal Fix

- **Original duration preserved** — Renewing an expired request now reactivates it for its original duration (24, 48, or 72 hours) instead of always defaulting to 24 hours

### Routing & Stability

- **Route resolution fixed** — Statistics and duration-tier endpoints no longer incorrectly match as request IDs
- **New submissions endpoint** — Request owners can now view submitted tracks directly (track name, producer name, timestamp)
- **Duration-aware copy** — All UI text now reflects the correct duration tier instead of hardcoded "24 hours"

### Producer Dashboard — Visual Consistency

A platform-wide harmonization pass across 50+ components in the Producer Dashboard and Beat Requests interface:

- **Unified icon library** — All dashboard icons now use a single consistent icon set with standardized sizing across every section
- **Semantic color tokens** — Replaced hardcoded color values with theme-aware tokens that adapt correctly to both light and dark mode
- **Dark mode fixes** — Fixed elements in the Beat Requests interface that only rendered correctly in dark mode (backgrounds, borders, dividers)
- **Consistent card styling** — Dashboard sections now share a unified card wrapper with consistent padding, borders, and header layouts
- **Header gradient overlays** — Page headers use theme-aware gradient overlays instead of hardcoded black/white values
- **Shared utility components** — New reusable components for page headers, section cards, stat grids, and number formatting reduce visual drift between pages

### Pricing Page Fix

- **Page loading restored** — Fixed a critical issue that could prevent the **Pricing** page from rendering correctly, showing an error instead of the plan comparison grid

### Code Quality & Accessibility

- **Locale-aware formatting** — Percentages and numbers in analytics charts now display correctly for all regions and languages
- **Internationalization** — Transaction history labels and filter buttons in **Finances** are now fully translatable
- **Accessibility** — Interactive filter buttons in the finances section now include proper state indicators for screen readers
- **Duplicate CSS cleanup** — Removed redundant border, ring, and spacing classes across dashboard components for cleaner rendering
- **Error monitoring** — Improved error capture in the audio player and post-purchase flows so issues surface faster

### Playback & Library

- **Play count display** — Fixed play count formatting in the hero carousel to show accurate, readable numbers
- **Library lyrics count** — The lyrics page header now shows the correct count when filtering or searching your saved lyrics
- **Dead code removed** — Cleaned up unused legacy files and redundant component props across the player and library

---

## Why It Matters

- **Producers** get a faster, smarter submission flow with safeguards against duplicates and clearer feedback
- **Requesters** can browse and manage requests more efficiently with filters, tabs, and accurate token tracking
- **Everyone** benefits from correct multi-token accounting — no more lost tokens when deleting or failing to create higher-tier requests
- **Visual consistency** — The Producer Dashboard and Beat Requests interface look polished in both light and dark mode
- **Reliability** — The pricing page, analytics charts, and audio player are more stable with improved error handling
