# Professional Credits Feature

<Info>
  **Release Date:** December 8, 2025
</Info>

We're excited to introduce **Professional Credits** — a new way for producers to showcase their work on other artists' projects directly on their BeatPass profile.

## What's New

### Spotify-Linked Credits

You can now add songs and albums you've worked on from Spotify to your producer profile. Credits appear in a dedicated **Credits** tab on your profile, giving visitors proof of your professional experience.

### Multi-Role Support

Select **multiple roles** for each credit. If you both produced and mixed a track, you can showcase both contributions:

- Producer, Co-Producer, Beat Maker
- Mixing Engineer, Mastering Engineer, Recording Engineer
- Songwriter, Composer, Arranger
- Featured Artist, Vocalist
- Executive Producer, A&R, Creative Director

### Album Import with Per-Track Editing

When adding an entire album, you can customize your role for each individual track. Perfect for projects where your contributions varied across songs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for the album on Spotify">
    Use the Spotify search to find the album you worked on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply default roles to all tracks">
    Set your default roles (e.g., Producer, Mixing Engineer) for all tracks at once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize individual tracks as needed">
    Adjust roles per track if your contribution varied across the album.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add all credits at once">
    Save time by importing the entire album to your profile in one action.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Immersive Profile Display

Credits appear as beautiful, immersive cards on your profile with:

- **Full cover art backgrounds** with gradient overlay
- **Type indicators** — Songs (green) or Albums (purple)
- **Popularity indicator** — 3-dot display showing Spotify popularity
- **Track count** — Shows total tracks for albums
- **Role badges** — Up to 2 visible with "+N more" for additional roles
- **Stacked card effect** for albums with multiple tracks

### Mobile-Optimized Design

Cards are responsive and optimized for all devices:

- **Mobile**: Rectangular cards (16:9) in single-column layout
- **Desktop**: Square cards in 2-4 column grid
- **Performance**: GPU-accelerated rendering, lazy-loaded images

### Role Filter Pills

Visitors can filter your credits by role type to quickly see all your work in a specific category — great for showcasing your mixing portfolio or production credits separately.

## How to Add Credits

1. Go to your artist profile edit page
2. Click the **Credits** tab
3. Click **Add Credit**
4. Search for songs or albums on Spotify
5. Select your role(s) for each credit
6. Save and your credits appear on your profile

## Technical Improvements

- **PHPStan Level 7 compliance** for all backend credit code
- **Automatic availability checks** — Credits are verified weekly against Spotify
- **Spotify data sync** — Popularity and track counts fetched from Spotify API
- **Smart grouping** — Multiple roles on the same song are grouped together
- **Performance optimizations**:
  - Memoized React components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Lazy-loaded images with `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"`
  - GPU-accelerated transforms for smooth scrolling
  - Simplified backdrop effects on mobile for better performance
  - `content-visibility: auto` for off-screen rendering optimization

## Database Updates

- Added `popularity` field — Stores Spotify's 0-100 popularity score
- Added `total_tracks` field — Stores album track count for direct album credits

## Admin Tools

A new artisan command is available for syncing credits with Spotify:

```bash
# Sync all credits
php artisan credits:sync-spotify

# Sync specific artist
php artisan credits:sync-spotify --artist=123

# Preview changes without applying
php artisan credits:sync-spotify --dry-run
```

## What's Next

- Drag-and-drop reordering for credits
- Additional music platforms beyond Spotify
- Credit verification badges
