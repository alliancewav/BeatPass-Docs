# Icon & Visual Standards

Consistent visual language for release notes to improve scannability and recognition.

<Warning>
  **Icon Library: Font Awesome 6 ONLY.** The BeatPass docs are configured with `"icons": { "library": "fontawesome" }` in `docs.json`. Never use Lucide, Heroicons, or any other library's icon names. Verify every icon at [fontawesome.com/icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons) before use.
</Warning>

## Usage Patterns

### In Cards

```mdx
<Card title="Feature Name" icon="star" color="#f59e0b">
  Description of the feature
</Card>
```

### In Accordions

```mdx
<Accordion title="Feature Category" icon="bolt">
  Content here
</Accordion>
```

## Color Accessibility

All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards:
- Dark text on light backgrounds
- Icons use high-contrast colors
- Avoid color-only indicators (always pair with icon or text)

---

<Card title="Production Launch" icon="rocket" color="#22c55e">
  <Badge color="green">v3.0.0</Badge>
  Major platform release

```

### Security Update
```mdx
<Card title="Security Patch" icon="shield" color="#dc2626">

</AccordionGroup>
```

## Prohibited Icons

Don't use:
- Emoji (🎉, 🔥, etc.) — inconsistent rendering
- Custom SVGs — maintenance burden
- Text-only indicators — accessibility issues
- Animated icons — distracting
- **Lucide icon names** — wrong library, will silently fail to render
- **Deprecated Font Awesome 4/5 names** — may not exist in FA6

Stick to **Font Awesome 6** icon names only. Verify at [fontawesome.com/icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

## Common Lucide → FA6 Mistakes

These Lucide names are frequently used by mistake. Always use the FA6 equivalent:

| ❌ Wrong (Lucide) | ✅ Correct (FA6) | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `zap` | `bolt` | Improvements |
| `alert-triangle` | `triangle-exclamation` | Deprecations |
| `alert-circle` | `circle-exclamation` | Hotfixes |
| `cloud-upload` | `cloud-arrow-up` | Upload flow |
| `message-square` | `comment` | Messaging |
| `file-text` | `file-lines` | Licensing |
| `play-circle` | `circle-play` | Player |
| `settings` | `gear` | Admin |
| `bar-chart` | `chart-bar` | Analytics |
| `scale` | `scale-balanced` | Legal |
| `edit` | `pen-to-square` | Editing |
| `trash-2` | `trash-can` | Deletion |
| `monitor` | `desktop` | Sessions |
| `disc` | `compact-disc` | Tracks/albums |
