## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Wrong: Too Broad
```yaml
audience: "All"  # When it's really just for producers
```

### ❌ Wrong: Too Narrow
```yaml
audience: "Producers"  # When billing changes affect all paying users
```

### ✅ Right: Precise Targeting
```yaml
# New dashboard feature only producers see
audience: "Producers"

# Billing changes affect all subscribers
audience: "All"

# Admin-only moderation tool
audience: "Admins"
```

---

## Edge Cases

### Producer + Artist Features
Choose "All" if both groups actively use the feature.

Example: New profile customization that both producers and artists have.

### Free vs Paid Features
- Free features → "Artists" or "All"
- Paid features → "All" (since free users might upgrade)

### Behind-the-Scenes Changes
- Infrastructure → "All" (if affects performance)
- Pure backend → Don't write a release note

## Testing Your Choice

Ask yourself:
1. "Would a free-tier artist care about this?"
2. "Would a producer be confused if they didn't see this?"
3. "Is this just for our internal team?"
4. "Would a developer need to know this to maintain an integration?"

If yes to #1 → "All" or "Artists"
If yes to #2 → "Producers"
If yes to #3 → "Admins"
If yes to #4 → "Developers"
