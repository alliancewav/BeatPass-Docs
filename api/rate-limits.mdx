description: "Understanding API rate limits and best practices for staying within limits."
---

## Overview

To ensure fair usage and platform stability, the BeatPass API enforces rate limits on all requests.

---

## Rate Limit Tiers

### Standard Limits

| Tier | Requests per Minute | Requests per Day |
|------|--------------------:|------------------:|
| Public | 60 | 1,000 |
| Authenticated | 120 | 10,000 |
| Approved Integration | 300 | 50,000 |

### Endpoint-Specific Limits

Some endpoints have stricter limits:

| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Search | 30/min |
| Upload | 10/min |
| Authentication | 10/min |

---

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes rate limit information:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 120
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 115
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1700000000
```

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when limit resets |

---

## Exceeding Limits

### 429 Response

When you exceed rate limits:

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60
```

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```

### What to Do

1. Stop making requests immediately
2. Wait for the `Retry-After` duration
3. Implement exponential backoff
4. Resume with reduced request rate

## Best Practices

### Optimize Requests

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cache Responses">
    Cache data locally to reduce API calls. Most data doesn't change frequently.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Pagination">
    Fetch only the data you need. Use pagination parameters effectively.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Batch Where Possible">
    Combine multiple items into single requests when supported.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Avoid Polling">
    Use webhooks instead of polling for real-time updates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Implement Backoff

When rate limited, use exponential backoff:

```javascript
async function fetchWithBackoff(url, attempt = 1) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (response.status === 429) {
      const retryAfter = response.headers.get('Retry-After') || Math.pow(2, attempt);
      await sleep(retryAfter * 1000);
      return fetchWithBackoff(url, attempt + 1);
    }
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    if (attempt < 5) {
      await sleep(Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000);
      return fetchWithBackoff(url, attempt + 1);
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Monitoring Usage

### Track Your Usage

- Monitor `X-RateLimit-Remaining` in responses
- Log all API requests with timestamps
- Set alerts before hitting limits
- Review usage patterns regularly

### Sample Tracking

```javascript
function logRequest(response) {
  const limit = response.headers.get('X-RateLimit-Limit');
  const remaining = response.headers.get('X-RateLimit-Remaining');
  const reset = response.headers.get('X-RateLimit-Reset');
  
  console.log(`Rate limit: ${remaining}/${limit}, resets at ${reset}`);
  
  if (remaining < 10) {
    console.warn('Approaching rate limit!');
  }
}
```

## Requesting Higher Limits

If you need higher rate limits:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document Your Use Case">
    Explain why you need increased limits.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Show Current Usage">
    Provide metrics on your current API usage patterns.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Contact Support">
    Submit a request with your documentation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review">
    We'll review and respond with a decision.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Higher limits are granted for legitimate use cases that benefit the platform ecosystem.

---

## Fair Use Policy

Rate limits exist to:

- Ensure platform stability
- Prevent abuse
- Provide fair access to all users
- Maintain service quality

Attempting to circumvent rate limits (multiple accounts, distributed requests) may result in API access revocation.
