## Overview

The BeatPass API uses token-based authentication. All authenticated endpoints require a valid access token.

---

## Authentication Methods

### Bearer Token

Include your access token in the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://beta.beatpass.ca/api/v1/user" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

---

## Obtaining Tokens

### For Users (OAuth Flow)

Standard users authenticate through the platform's OAuth flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Redirect to Auth">
    Redirect users to BeatPass login.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="User Authorizes">
    User grants your application permission.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive Code">
    Receive authorization code via callback.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Exchange for Token">
    Exchange code for access token.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### For Integrations (API Key)

Approved integrators receive API keys:

1. Contact support for API access
2. Describe your integration use case
3. Receive credentials upon approval
4. Use key as bearer token

<Warning>
  Never expose API keys in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Token Security

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Tokens Secret">
    Never commit tokens to version control. Use environment variables.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use HTTPS">
    All API requests must use HTTPS to protect tokens in transit.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rotate Regularly">
    Rotate tokens periodically. Contact support to regenerate if compromised.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Minimize Scope">
    Request only the permissions your application needs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### If Compromised

If you believe your token is compromised:

1. Contact support immediately
2. Request token revocation
3. Generate new credentials
4. Update your application

## Authentication Errors

| Status | Meaning | Solution |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 401 | Unauthorized | Check token validity |
| 403 | Forbidden | Token lacks required permissions |

### Error Response

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Unauthenticated.",
  "code": 401
}
```

---

## Token Lifetime

| Token Type | Lifetime |
|------------|----------|
| Access Token | Varies by grant type |
| API Key | Until revoked |

<Note>
  Implement token refresh logic in your application to handle expiration gracefully.
</Note>

---

## Scopes

Available permission scopes:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read:tracks` | Access track data |
| `read:artists` | Access artist data |
| `read:user` | Access authenticated user data |
| `write:user` | Modify user data |

Request only the scopes you need.

---

## Testing Authentication

Verify your setup with a simple request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://beta.beatpass.ca/api/v1/user" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Successful response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "display_name": "Username"
  }
}
```
