## For Producers: Responding to Requests

### Finding Requests

Browse requests that match your style:

1. Go to **Beat Requests** section
2. Filter by genre, budget, or recency
3. Read descriptions carefully
4. Check the artist's profile and history

### Submitting a Response

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Matching Request">
    Look for requests that align with your catalog or style.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Prepare Your Response">
    Either:
    - Link an existing track from your catalog
    - Create a new beat specifically for the request
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit Your Response">
    Include a message explaining why your beat fits their needs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for Feedback">
    The artist will review submissions and may:
    - Accept and purchase
    - Request modifications
    - Pass and continue searching
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Response Best Practices

<Tip>
  Personalize your message. Generic responses like "Check this out" are less effective than explaining why your beat matches their description.
</Tip>

| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Reference their specific requirements | Send unrelated beats |
| Explain how your beat fits | Copy-paste the same message |
| Be open to negotiation | Ignore their budget range |
| Respond promptly | Wait days to reply |
