## For Buyers: Making Payments

### Payment Methods

BeatPass accepts:

- Credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover)
- Apple Pay and Google Pay (where supported by browser)

### Per-Track Purchase Flow

BeatPass uses a per-track purchase model—no cart or checkout page. Each track is purchased individually.

<Steps>
  <Step title="View Track">
    Navigate to the track page you want to license.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select License">
    Choose your license tier (Non-Exclusive or Exclusive).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initiate Purchase">
    Click **Buy License**. The system calculates the final price including any platform fees.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Payment">
    Complete payment via Stripe's secure checkout (card or digital wallet).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Payment is processed. License is generated automatically.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Files">
    Download track files and your license certificate immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  There is no shopping cart. Each license purchase is a separate transaction.

### Payout Flow for License Sales

When a buyer purchases your track:

1. **Payment collected** - Stripe processes the buyer's payment
2. **Fees deducted** - Platform fee and Stripe processing fees removed
3. **Transfer initiated** - Remaining amount transferred to your Stripe Connect account
4. **Payout to bank** - Stripe pays out to your bank per your schedule

### Payout Schedule

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **License Sales** | Transferred immediately after purchase (minus fees) |
| **Contribution Pool** | Monthly calculation, processed first week of following month |
| **Bank Payout** | Per your Stripe settings (typically 2-5 business days) |

### Payout Dashboard
