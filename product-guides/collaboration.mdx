## Revenue Splits

<Warning>
  **Manual Process Only** — BeatPass does not automatically split payments between collaborators. All revenue goes to the primary uploader. You must handle splits privately.
</Warning>

### How It Works

| Component | Recipient |
|-----------|-----------|
| License sales | Primary uploader only |
| Contribution earnings | Primary uploader only |
| Streaming revenue | Primary uploader only |

### Manual Split Checklist

Follow this workflow to handle revenue splits professionally:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agree on Terms Before Upload">
    **Before** uploading the collaborative track:
    - Define each collaborator's percentage
    - Specify what triggers payment (monthly, per-sale, threshold)
    - Agree on who handles which costs (mastering, promotion)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Document the Agreement">
    Create a written agreement covering:
    - Track title and collaborator names
    - Split percentages (e.g., 50/50, 60/40)
    - Payment method and timing
    - What happens if track is removed or exclusive is sold
    - Dispute resolution process
    
    <Tip>
      Even a simple email exchange confirming terms is better than nothing. For significant releases, consider a formal collaboration agreement.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Track Earnings">
    The primary uploader should:
    - Monitor sales in **Backstage > Finances**
    - Keep records of all transactions
    - Share earnings reports with collaborators (screenshot or export)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pay Collaborators">
    Settle splits using your preferred method:
    - PayPal, Venmo, or bank transfer
    - Cryptocurrency
    - Check or cash
    
    <Note>
      Keep payment receipts. Send payment promptly per your agreement.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Receipt">
    Have collaborators confirm they received payment. This closes the loop and prevents disputes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Split Agreement Template

A basic collaboration agreement should include:

```
COLLABORATION AGREEMENT

Track: [Track Title]
Upload Date: [Date]
Primary Uploader: [Name/Username]

Collaborators and Splits:
- [Name 1]: [X]%
- [Name 2]: [Y]%

Payment Terms:
- Frequency: [Monthly / Per-sale / When threshold of $X reached]
- Method: [PayPal / Venmo / Other]
- Due within: [X days] of earnings receipt

Agreed by:
[Signature/confirmation from each party]
[Date]
```

### Exclusive Sale Considerations

If an exclusive license is sold:

| Scenario | Recommended Action |
|----------|-------------------|
| Exclusive sold | Split the sale price per agreement |
| Track removed after sale | No future earnings; final split based on sale |
| Dispute over exclusive | Refer to written agreement; contact support if needed |

### Common Split Structures

| Arrangement | Typical Split |
|-------------|---------------|
| Equal co-production | 50/50 |
| Beat + topline/melody | 60/40 or 70/30 |
| Full beat + minor contribution | 80/20 or 90/10 |
| Mix/master credit only | Flat fee, no ongoing split |

<Warning>
  Failure to honor split agreements damages your reputation. The producer community is small—word travels fast.
</Warning>

## Finding Collaborators

### Through Beat Requests

Many collaborations start from beat request interactions:

1. Artist posts a request
2. Multiple producers respond
3. Producers connect with each other
4. Future collaborations emerge

### Through the Platform

- Browse producer profiles
- Follow creators whose style complements yours
- Engage through messaging
- Propose collaboration opportunities

## Reposts

Reposts let you share tracks to your profile, helping collaborators and favorite producers gain visibility.

### How Reposts Work

When you repost a track:

1. It appears on your profile in a "Reposts" section
2. Your followers see it in their feed
3. The original creator is notified
4. You can undo at any time

### Reposting a Track

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Track">
    Navigate to any track page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Repost">
    Click the repost icon (🔄) below the track.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Track is immediately shared to your profile.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Undoing a Repost

To remove a repost:

1. Go to the track page (or your profile > Reposts)
2. Click the repost icon again
3. The repost is removed instantly

### Where Reposts Appear

| Location | Visibility |
|----------|------------|
| Your profile | "Reposts" tab |
| Followers' feeds | Activity feed |
| Track page | Shows repost count |

### Repost Limits

To prevent spam:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Reposts per hour | 20 |
| Reposts per day | 100 |

<Note>
  Reposts don't affect the original track's ownership or analytics—they're purely for sharing and discovery.
</Note>
