## Metadata Best Practices

### Title Guidelines

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do">
    - Keep it short and memorable (2-4 words)
    - Use descriptive keywords
    - Make it searchable
    - Example: "Midnight Chase", "Summer Waves"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't">
    - Use generic names ("Beat 1", "Untitled")
    - Include "Type Beat" unless strategic
    - Use special characters
    - Make it too long
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Tag Strategy

Effective tagging improves discovery:

| Category  | Examples                           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Mood      | dark, uplifting, aggressive, chill |
| Style     | melodic, hard, bouncy, atmospheric |
| Use Case  | freestyle, hook, verse, commercial |
| Influence | drake type, metro boomin style     |

<Tip>
  Use 5-10 tags per track. Too few limits discovery; too many dilutes relevance.
</Tip>

### BPM Accuracy

Accurate BPM helps artists find matching beats:

| Genre   | Typical BPM Range |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| Trap    | 130-170           |
| Hip Hop | 80-100            |
| Drill   | 140-150           |
| R&B     | 60-90             |
| Lo-Fi   | 70-90             |

## Bulk Uploads

<Note>
  Bulk upload tools are in development. Currently, tracks must be uploaded individually.
</Note>

- Play count and completion rate
- Save count

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload fails or times out">
    Check file size and format. Try a different browser. Ensure stable internet connection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audio sounds different after upload">
    BeatPass transcodes for streaming. Download your original for comparison. Report issues if quality is significantly degraded.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Track not appearing in search">
    Allow 5-10 minutes for indexing. Verify metadata is complete. Check that track is published, not drafted.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
