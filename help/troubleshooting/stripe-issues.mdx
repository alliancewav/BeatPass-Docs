## I Haven't Connected My Stripe Account

  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Finances">
    Click on **Finances** in your dashboard menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Connect Stripe Account'">
    Click the **Connect Stripe Account** button to start the onboarding process.

## What Payouts Can I Receive?

Once connected, you can receive earnings from:

| Revenue Stream | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Monthly Payouts** | Automatic revenue share from the subscription pool based on your contribution value |
| **Exclusive Sales** | 100% of your set price when someone purchases exclusive rights to your track |
| **Track Purchases** | 100% of track purchase revenue directly to your account |

<Tip>
  You keep 100% of your set price on all sales. The platform fee is added on top for buyers, not deducted from your earnings.
</Tip>

## Stripe Onboarding Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Onboarding link isn't working">
    If clicking the connect button doesn't redirect you to Stripe:
    1. Check that popups aren't blocked for beatpass.ca

    4. If the issue persists, contact support at **contact@beatpass.ca**
  </Accordion>

    - **Document type not accepted** — Use a government-issued ID (passport, driver's license)
    
    If you're stuck, contact Stripe Support directly from their dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I'm from a country that isn't supported">
