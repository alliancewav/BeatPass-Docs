When you purchase a beat on BeatPass, a 15% platform fee is added to the producer's listed price. This page explains how the fee works and where your money goes.

---

## How the Fee Works

The platform fee is **added on top** of the producer's price—not deducted from it.

### Example

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| **Producer's listed price** | $100.00 |
| **Platform fee (15%)** | $15.00 |
| **Total you pay** | $115.00 |

In this example:
- You pay $115.00
- The producer receives $100.00
- BeatPass receives $15.00

<Note>
  Producers set their own prices and receive 100% of their listed price. The platform fee is a separate charge added at checkout.
</Note>

## Why We Charge a Fee

The platform fee supports:

- **Platform development** — Building and improving BeatPass features
- **Infrastructure** — Servers, storage, and technical operations
- **Secure payments** — Safe payment processing for all transactions
- **Support services** — Customer and producer support
- **Community features** — Beat requests, messaging, and discovery tools

---

## Fee Transparency

### What You See

When purchasing a beat:

1. **Product page** — Shows the producer's price
2. **Checkout** — Shows price + platform fee = total
3. **Invoice** — Itemized breakdown of charges

### No Hidden Fees

The 15% platform fee is the only additional charge. There are no hidden processing fees or surprise charges.

---

## Who Pays the Fee

| Party | What They Pay |
|-------|---------------|
| **Buyer (You)** | Producer's price + 15% platform fee |
| **Producer** | Nothing—receives full listed price |

This model ensures producers can set prices confidently, knowing they receive exactly what they list.

---

## Fee on Different Purchases

The platform fee applies to:

- **Beat purchases** — Individual track licenses
- **Exclusive purchases** — Exclusive rights to beats

### Subscriptions

The platform fee does **not** apply to subscription payments. Subscription pricing is fixed and inclusive.

## Comparison to Other Platforms

BeatPass's fee structure differs from some platforms where fees are deducted from the seller's earnings:

| Platform Type | How Fee Works | Producer Gets |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **BeatPass** | Fee added on top | 100% of listed price |
| **Other platforms** | Fee deducted | Less than listed price |
