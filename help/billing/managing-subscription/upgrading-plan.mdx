Upgrading your subscription gives you access to additional features and benefits. When you upgrade, the change can take effect immediately, and you're only charged the prorated difference.

## What Happens When You Upgrade

### Immediate Access

When you upgrade:

- **New features activate instantly** — You can start using upgraded features right away
- **No waiting period** — The upgrade takes effect as soon as payment is processed

### How Billing Works

Upgrades use prorated billing:

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| **Same billing cycle** | You're charged only the price difference for remaining days |
| **Different cycle** | If switching from monthly to yearly, you're charged the new amount minus unused credit |

### Example

If you're 15 days into a $10/month plan and upgrade to a $20/month plan:
- You've used half your current period ($5 value)
- You have $5 credit remaining
- You pay $20 (new plan) - $5 (credit) = $15 for this cycle
- Future months charge the full $20

<Note>
  Exact proration calculations depend on your specific billing dates and plan prices.
</Note>

## Requirements for Upgrading

### Payment Method Required

To upgrade immediately, you must have a valid payment method on file:

- A credit or debit card saved to your account
- Or an active PayPal connection (if available)

If you don't have a payment method, you'll be prompted to add one before completing the upgrade.

### Active Subscription

You can upgrade from:

- An active paid subscription
- A free plan
- A cancelled subscription still in its grace period

## Choosing the Right Plan

Before upgrading, consider:

- **Features you need** — What specific features does the higher plan offer?
- **Beat request limits** — Higher plans may include more beat request tokens
- **Storage space** — Producers may need more space for uploads
- **Billing frequency** — Yearly plans often provide a discount

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My upgrade failed">
    Check that your payment method is valid and has sufficient funds. The card may have been declined due to:
    - Insufficient balance
    - Expired card
    - Card issuer security block
    
    Try updating your payment method and attempting the upgrade again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I don't see the features after upgrading">
    Try refreshing the page or logging out and back in. New features should appear immediately after a successful upgrade.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I was charged more than expected">
    If switching billing cycles (e.g., monthly to yearly), you'll be charged the full yearly amount minus any credit from your current cycle. Review your invoice for details.
