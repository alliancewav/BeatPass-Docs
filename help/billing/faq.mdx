## Subscription Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I change my subscription plan?">
    Go to **Settings** → **Subscription** → **Change Plan**. Select your desired plan and confirm. Upgrades take effect immediately; downgrades are scheduled for your next renewal date.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When will I be charged?">
    Subscriptions are charged at the start of each billing period. Your next charge date is shown in **Settings** → **Subscription** as the renewal date.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel anytime?">
    Yes. You can cancel your subscription at any time. You'll keep access to your plan's features until the end of your current billing period.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens when I cancel?">
    After cancelling, you enter a grace period where you keep all features until your current period ends. You won't be charged again, and you can resume during the grace period if you change your mind.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund if I cancel early?">
    We don't provide prorated refunds for cancellations. When you cancel, you keep access until your period ends. If you have special circumstances, contact support.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between monthly and yearly billing?">
    Monthly billing charges you each month with the flexibility to cancel anytime. Yearly billing charges once per year, often at a discounted rate compared to 12 monthly payments.
  </Accordion>

## Payment Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What payment methods do you accept?">
    We accept major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover) through Stripe. PayPal is also available when enabled.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is my payment information secure?">
    Yes. We use Stripe, a PCI-compliant payment processor. Your full card details are never stored on our servers—only the card brand, last 4 digits, and expiration for identification.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why was my card declined?">
    Cards can be declined for several reasons:
    - Insufficient funds
    - Expired card
    - Bank fraud protection
    - International transaction blocks
    
    Try updating your payment method or contact your bank.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I update my payment method?">
    Go to **Settings** → **Subscription** → **Payment Method** and click **Update**. Enter your new card details and save.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use PayPal?">
    PayPal is available as a payment option when enabled. If you don't see it during checkout, it may not be available for your transaction type or region.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Plan Change Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do upgrades work?">
    When you upgrade, the new plan takes effect immediately. You're charged a prorated amount for the remaining time in your billing cycle, then the full new price at renewal.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do downgrades work?">
    Downgrades are scheduled for your next renewal date. You keep your current plan's features until then, and the new lower price applies starting from renewal.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel a pending plan change?">
    Yes. If you've scheduled a downgrade, you can cancel it before it takes effect in **Settings** → **Subscription**. Look for the pending change notice and click to cancel it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I upgraded but don't see new features">
    Try refreshing the page or logging out and back in. New features should appear immediately after a successful upgrade payment.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Invoice & History Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where can I view my invoices?">
    Go to **Settings** → **Subscription** → **Invoices** to see your billing history, including subscription payments and beat purchases.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I download invoices?">
    Yes. Open any invoice and look for the download or print option to save it as a PDF for your records.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why don't I see a recent payment?">
    It may take a few moments for new transactions to appear. If it's been more than a few minutes, check your email for payment confirmation or contact support.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Platform Fee Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the platform fee?">
    When purchasing beats, a 15% platform fee is added to the producer's listed price. If a beat costs $100, you pay $115 total. The producer receives the full $100.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does the fee apply to subscriptions?">
    No. The 15% platform fee only applies to beat purchases, not subscription payments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why is the fee added on top?">
    This ensures producers receive exactly what they list as their price—100% goes to them. The fee is transparent and added separately at checkout.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I was charged twice">
    Double charges are rare. Check your bank statement to confirm—sometimes pending authorizations appear as separate charges but only one is finalized. If you see two completed charges, contact support with transaction details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My subscription didn't renew">
    If your payment method failed, your subscription may not renew. Update your payment method in **Settings** → **Subscription**. If you're in the grace period, you may be able to resume without resubscribing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I need to dispute a charge">
    Contact support first to resolve the issue. We can review your account and process refunds if appropriate. Disputing through your bank should be a last resort.
  </Accordion>
