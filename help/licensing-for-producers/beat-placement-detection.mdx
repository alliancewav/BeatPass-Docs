BeatPass automatically scans global music databases to detect when your beats appear in songs released on Spotify, YouTube, and Deezer. This feature is available exclusively for verified producer profiles.

## How It Works

BeatPass uses <Tooltip tip="BeatPass's audio fingerprinting technology that creates a unique digital signature of your beat's audio waveform.">BeatPassID</Tooltip> fingerprinting technology to compare your uploaded beats against millions of songs across major streaming platforms. When a match is found, you're notified with full details about the song, the releasing artist, and where to listen.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your beat is fingerprinted">
    When you upload a beat, BeatPassID creates a unique audio fingerprint — a digital signature of your beat's sound.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monthly scanning">
    BeatPass automatically scans your beats against global music databases each month. No action is required from you.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Match detected">
    When a song on Spotify, YouTube, or Deezer matches your beat's audio fingerprint, a placement is recorded.
  </Step>

  <Step title="You're notified">
    You receive an in-app notification and an email with the song details, streaming links, and match confidence score.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Requirements

To use beat placement detection, you need:

- A **verified producer profile** — [Request verification](https://open.beatpass.ca/backstage/requests/verify-artist) if you haven't already
- At least one **uploaded beat** hosted on BeatPass (not external links)
- A completed **audio fingerprint** for your beat (generated automatically on upload)

<Info>
  For collaborative beats, only one producer on the track needs to be verified for the scan to run. All producers linked to the beat are notified when a placement is found — even if they aren't individually verified.
</Info>

## Viewing Your Placements

When placements are detected, they appear in the **Heard In** section on your track page.

Each placement shows:

- **Song title and artist** — The name of the song and who released it
- **Confidence score** — How closely the song matches your beat (80% minimum to display)
- **Streaming links** — Direct links to listen on Spotify, YouTube, and Deezer
- **Release date** — When the song was published
- **Album and label** — Additional release information when available

<Note>
  Only you and other producers credited on the beat can see the **Heard In** section. It's not visible to listeners or other users.
</Note>

## Understanding Confidence Scores

The confidence score indicates how closely a detected song matches your beat's audio fingerprint:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **90–100%** | Very high match — the song almost certainly uses your beat |
| **80–89%** | High match — the song likely uses your beat, worth verifying |

Only matches with 80% or higher confidence are shown. Lower-confidence matches are filtered out to reduce false positives.

## Notifications

When a new placement is detected, you receive:

- **In-app notification** — Visible in your notification center (bell icon)
- **Email notification** — Detailed email with streaming links, placement information, and verification guidance

You can manage these notifications from your [notification preferences](https://open.beatpass.ca/notifications/settings). Beat Placement Detection notifications appear under the **Beat Placement Detection** group, which is available for verified producers.

## Verifying a Placement

When you receive a placement notification, take these steps to verify it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Listen to the song">
    Use the streaming links in your notification or on the track page to listen and confirm the song uses your beat.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check your download history">
    If the user obtained your beat through BeatPass, a <Tooltip tip="An automatically generated legal document proving the user has the right to use your beat, including audio fingerprint verification.">license certificate</Tooltip> was created at the time of download and you would have received a download notification email.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Contact the user if needed">
    If you don't recognize the placement or didn't receive a download notification, reach out to the releasing artist directly to request proof of a valid BeatPass license.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Contact support for unauthorized use">
    If you believe your beat was used without a valid license, contact BeatPass support. We can verify licensing records and help you with next steps.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How This Connects to BeatPass Licensing

Beat placement detection works alongside BeatPass's existing licensing infrastructure:

### License Certificates

Every beat downloaded through BeatPass generates an automatic <Tooltip tip="An official document proving someone has the right to use your beat, including a unique License ID, terms, and BeatPassID audio fingerprint.">license certificate</Tooltip>. When you see a placement, you can cross-reference it with your download notifications and license records to confirm whether the user obtained your beat legitimately.

### BeatPassID Fingerprinting

The same <Tooltip tip="BeatPass's audio fingerprinting technology that creates a unique digital signature of your beat's audio waveform.">BeatPassID</Tooltip> technology that powers license certificate verification also powers placement detection. Your beat's audio fingerprint is compared against streaming catalogs to identify matches.

### Sample-Safe Warranty

BeatPass beats come with a <Tooltip tip="A guarantee that the beat was originally produced and uploaded by the credited producer, backed by BeatPassID audio fingerprint verification.">sample-safe warranty</Tooltip> — meaning the beat was originally produced and uploaded by the credited producer, backed by BeatPassID verification. If a placement is found and the user has a valid BeatPass license, both parties are protected by the platform's licensing terms.

## Scanning Schedule

- Scans run **automatically each month** — no manual action required
- Each scan compares your beats against the latest streaming catalog data
- New placements are detected as songs are added to Spotify, YouTube, and Deezer
- You're only notified once per new placement (rescans don't trigger duplicate notifications)

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why don't I see the Heard In section on my track?">
    The **Heard In** section only appears for producers who uploaded the beat. If you're a verified producer and don't see it, your beat may not have been scanned yet (scans run monthly) or no placements have been detected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I trigger a scan manually?">
    Scans are automated and run monthly. You cannot trigger a manual scan at this time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I'm not verified?">
    Beat placement detection requires a verified producer profile. You can [request verification](https://open.beatpass.ca/backstage/requests/verify-artist) from your Backstage area. Once verified, your beats will be included in the next monthly scan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if someone used my beat without a license?">
    Contact BeatPass support with the placement details. We can check our licensing records to verify whether a valid license exists. If the use is unauthorized, we can advise you on next steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this work for collaborative beats?">
    Yes. For collaborative beats, only one credited producer needs to be verified for the beat to be scanned. All credited producers with BeatPass accounts are notified when a placement is found, regardless of their individual verification status.
