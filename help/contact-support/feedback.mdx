## Writing Effective Feedback

Good feedback helps us understand and prioritize improvements.

### Be Specific

Instead of:
> "The search could be better"

Try:
> "It would be helpful if the beat search could filter by key signature and tempo range, so I can find beats that match my vocal recordings."

### Explain the Problem

Help us understand:
- What are you trying to accomplish?
- What's preventing you from doing it easily?
- How does this affect your workflow?

### Include Examples

If possible, provide:
- Screenshots showing what you mean
- Specific scenarios where this would be useful
- How other platforms handle similar features (if relevant)
