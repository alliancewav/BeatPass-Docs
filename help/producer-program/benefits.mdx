As a BeatPass producer, you get access to tools, earnings, and features designed to help you build your music career.

## Revenue & Earnings

### 85% Revenue Share

You keep 85% of all earnings from your beats. When members download or license your tracks, you earn the majority of that transaction.

| Party | Share |
|-------|-------|
| You (Producer) | 85% |
| Platform | 15% |

### Multiple Income Streams

Earn from different sources:

- **Non-exclusive downloads** — Members with paid subscriptions can download your beats
- **Exclusive licenses** — Sell exclusive rights to your beats at premium prices
- **Plays** — Contribute to subscription pool revenue based on track popularity

---

## Upload & Catalog

### Unlimited Uploads

There's no cap on how many beats you can upload. Build as large a catalog as you want without worrying about hitting limits.

### Catalog Management
