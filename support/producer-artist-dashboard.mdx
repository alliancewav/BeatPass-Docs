## Overview

The **Producer & Artist Dashboard** in Backstage is the fastest way to see how your catalog is performing. It surfaces **plays**, **followers**, and **upload health** so you can understand what is growing, what needs attention, and where collaborations are working.

<Info>
  - **Where:** Backstage → Insights → Dashboard
  - **Who:** Approved producers/artists with Backstage access
  - **API:** Authenticated endpoints under `/api/v1/artist/*` with the `artist.dashboard:read` scope
</Info>

## Open the dashboard in Backstage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in and go to Backstage">
    From the main BeatPass nav, click **Backstage**. This opens the producer workspace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Insights → Dashboard">
    In the left sidebar choose **Insights**, then select **Dashboard**. This view aggregates your plays, follower trendlines, and upload health cards.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter by artist (if you manage multiple)">
    Use the artist switcher in the header to pick the profile you want to analyze. The cards refresh for that artist only.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If you collaborate under multiple artist profiles, switch to the right profile before reviewing stats. The API endpoints below mirror the same selection logic and require the `artist.dashboard:read` scope on your authenticated session.
</Note>

## What you see on the dashboard

<Cards>
  <Card title="Plays & engagement" icon="chart-line">
    Total plays, average plays per track, top track with its play count, and play growth vs last month are surfaced from `/api/v1/artist/dashboard-stats`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Followers" icon="users">
    Current follower count and recent followers come from `/artists/{artist}/followers`. Use the **Followers** widget to see whether recent uploads convert listeners.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Upload health" icon="heart-pulse">
    Upload velocity and quality recommendations (uploads this month vs last month, average plays per upload, best performing month, and suggested cadence) are powered by `/api/v1/artist/upload-insights`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Collaborations" icon="handshake">
    The **Collaborations** tile links to `/api/v1/artist/{artist}/collaborative-tracks`, so you can inspect co-produced tracks alongside your own uploads.
  </Card>
</Cards>

<Warning>
  Upload health requires **upload access** on the artist profile. If you lose upload permissions, the dashboard hides these cards and the API returns `403 Upload access required`.
</Warning>
