## Upload Best Practices

### Audio Requirements

| Format | Quality  | Recommendation          |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------------- |
| WAV    | Lossless | Preferred for licensing |
| MP3    | 320kbps+ | Acceptable minimum      |
| FLAC   | Lossless | Accepted                |

<Warning>
  Low-quality audio affects your Quality Score and listener experience.
</Warning>

### Metadata Excellence

Complete metadata dramatically improves discovery:

- **Title**: Clear, memorable, searchable
- **BPM**: Accurate to help artists find matching beats
- **Key & Scale**: Helps artists match to their vocals
- **Genre**: Primary genre (most important filter)
- **Tags**: 5-10 relevant mood/style tags
- **Description**: Describe the vibe, inspiration, or use cases

### Pricing Strategy

  <Tab title="Licensing">
    Set prices for different license tiers:

    - **Non-Exclusive**: Lower price, ongoing availability
    - **Exclusive**: Premium price, one-time sale
