The BeatPass API powers the platform's frontend. This is a **first-party API** designed exclusively for BeatPass web and mobile applications.

<Warning>
  **First-Party Only** — BeatPass does not offer a public developer API or third-party integrations. All endpoints documented here are for the official BeatPass application.

## Request Format

### HTTP Methods

| Method | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| GET | Retrieve data |
| POST | Create resources or perform actions |
| PUT | Update resources |
| DELETE | Remove resources |

### Required Headers

```http
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

Authenticated requests use Sanctum's stateful session cookies. State-changing requests must include CSRF protection (`XSRF-TOKEN` cookie + `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header). See the [Authentication guide](/developers/auth) for the SPA login flow and CSRF requirements.

---

## Response Format

### Success Response

Responses vary by endpoint. Most return data directly:

```json
{
  "id": 1234,
  "name": "Track Name",
  "artist": {...}
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "message": "Error description",
  "errors": {
    "field": ["Validation error"]
  }
}
```

### Pagination

Paginated endpoints use Laravel's standard pagination:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "current_page": 1,
  "per_page": 15,
  "total": 150,
  "last_page": 10,
  "links": {...}
}
```

---

## Authentication Model

BeatPass uses **Laravel Sanctum** for authentication. This is a **stateful SPA session** model with CSRF/XSRF cookies. The API:

- Uses session cookies for authentication (not Bearer tokens)
- Does **not** issue personal access tokens
- Is only available to the first-party BeatPass web application (no third-party/OAuth)

See [Authentication](/developers/auth) for the SPA login flow and CSRF requirements.

---

## Key Endpoint Groups

### Public Endpoints (Optional Auth)

These endpoints work without authentication but return enhanced data when authenticated:

```http
GET /tracks              # List public tracks
GET /tracks/{id}         # Track details
GET /artists             # List artists
GET /artists/{id}        # Artist profile
GET /search              # Search content
GET /genres              # Available genres
```

### Required Auth Endpoints

These require an authenticated session:

```http
POST /tracks                           # Upload track
POST /tracks/{track}/purchase/initiate # Start purchase
GET  /purchases                        # User's purchases
GET  /messaging/conversations          # User's messages
GET  /producer-intelligence/dashboard  # Producer analytics
POST /beat-requests                    # Create beat request
```

---

## Rate Limiting

The API uses route-specific throttling. Key limits:

| Route Group | Limit |
|-------------|-------|
| Producer Intelligence (public) | 300 requests/minute |
| Producer Intelligence (auth) | 500 requests/minute |
| Social Analytics | 120 requests/minute |
| Legacy Producer Dashboard | 60 requests/minute |

See [Rate Limits](/developers/rate-limits) for complete details.

---

## Webhooks

BeatPass receives **inbound webhooks** from Stripe for payment processing. There is no outbound webhook system for external integrations.

See [Webhooks](/developers/webhooks) for Stripe webhook details.

---

## What's Not Covered

This documentation covers **user-facing endpoints only**. The following are intentionally excluded:

### Admin & Staff Endpoints

Admin routes require elevated privileges and are protected by role-based access control. These endpoints are not accessible to regular users and are not documented here.

### Internal Tooling

Internal endpoints used for platform operations, content processing, and infrastructure management are not publicly documented.

### Not Documented

| Category | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| **Admin operations** | Requires staff roles |
| **Internal processing** | Platform infrastructure |
| **Security systems** | Protected by design |

### Security Notice

<Warning>
  Attempting to access undocumented admin or internal endpoints without authorization is a violation of terms of service and may result in account termination.
</Warning>

If you discover an undocumented endpoint that appears to be a security concern, please report it responsibly to security@beatpass.ca.
