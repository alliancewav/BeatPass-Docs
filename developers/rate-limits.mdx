## Overview

BeatPass uses route-specific rate limiting via Laravel's throttle middleware. Different endpoint groups have different limits based on their resource intensity and expected usage patterns.

---

## Route-Specific Limits

### Producer Intelligence

<Info>
  **Updated December 2025:** Rate limits increased for cached endpoints.
</Info>

| Endpoint | Limit | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `/producer-intelligence/leaderboard` | 600/min | Cached responses (~25ms) |
| `/producer-intelligence/tracks/growth-batch` | 120/min | Batch endpoint for up to 100 tracks |
| `/producer-intelligence/track/{id}/growth` | 1200/min | Single track (prefer batch endpoint) |
| Authenticated dashboard, analytics | 500/min | Requires auth |
| Social analytics | 120/min | Rate-limited for performance |

### Legacy Endpoints

| Route | Limit | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `/users/{user}/producer-dashboard` | 60/min | Deprecated, use producer-intelligence |

### Authentication

Authentication attempts are limited to prevent brute force attacks:

| Action | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Login attempts | 5/min per IP |
| Password reset | 3/min per email |
| 2FA verification | 5/min per session |

---

## Rate Limit Format

Rate limits are expressed as requests per time window:

- **Requests:** Maximum number of requests allowed
- **Window:** Time period (typically 1 minute)

Example: "60 requests per minute" means you can make 60 requests within any 60-second window.

---

## Rate Limit Headers

Responses include standard rate limit headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 300
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 298
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1700000060
```

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests in window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests left in current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when limit resets |

---

## When Limits Are Exceeded

### 429 Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60
```

```json
{
  "message": "Too Many Attempts.",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```

### Handling Rate Limits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop Requests">
    Immediately pause further requests to the limited endpoint.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Retry-After">
    Read the `Retry-After` header for wait duration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implement Backoff">
    Use exponential backoff for retries.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resume Carefully">
    Resume with reduced frequency.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Optimize Request Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Batch Endpoints">
    The Producer Intelligence API provides batch endpoints:
    ```http
    POST /producer-intelligence/tracks/growth-batch
    ```
    Handles up to 100 tracks per request instead of individual calls.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cache Responses">
    Analytics data doesn't change frequently. Cache responses for 5-15 minutes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Combined Endpoints">
    Use `/producer-intelligence/progress-data` for combined dashboard data instead of multiple calls.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Paginate Efficiently">
    Request appropriate page sizes. Don't fetch more data than needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Exponential Backoff

```javascript
async function fetchWithBackoff(url, options = {}, attempt = 1) {
  const maxAttempts = 5;
  
  const response = await fetch(url, options);
  
  if (response.status === 429 && attempt < maxAttempts) {
    const retryAfter = parseInt(response.headers.get('Retry-After')) || Math.pow(2, attempt);
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter * 1000));
    return fetchWithBackoff(url, options, attempt + 1);
  }
  
  return response;
}
```

## Monitoring Usage

### Track Rate Limit Status

```javascript
async function apiRequest(url, options) {
  const response = await fetch(url, options);
  
  const remaining = response.headers.get('X-RateLimit-Remaining');
  const limit = response.headers.get('X-RateLimit-Limit');
  
  if (remaining && parseInt(remaining) < 10) {
    console.warn(`Rate limit warning: ${remaining}/${limit} remaining`);
  }
  
  return response;
}
```

### Common Patterns That Trigger Limits

| Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Polling leaderboards | High frequency checks | Use longer intervals (30s+) |
| Individual track growth | Too many single-track calls | Use batch endpoint |
| Page load analytics | Multiple concurrent requests | Consolidate into single call |
| Search-as-you-type | Request per keystroke | Debounce input (300ms+) |

---

## Rate Limits by Feature

### Low-Intensity Endpoints (No explicit throttle)

These endpoints use global defaults:

- Track/album/artist listing and details
- Playlist operations
- User profile data
- Genre and tag lookups

### High-Intensity Endpoints (Throttled)

These have explicit rate limits:

| Feature | Reason for Limit |
|---------|------------------|
| Producer Intelligence | Heavy computation |
| Social Analytics | Complex queries |
| Legacy Dashboard | Deprecated, encouraging migration |
| Real-time Analytics | Database intensive |

---

## Error Recovery

When you hit a rate limit:

1. **Don't retry immediately** - This wastes your remaining quota
2. **Log the incident** - Track which endpoints are hitting limits
3. **Review access patterns** - Identify optimization opportunities
4. **Contact support** - If legitimate usage requires higher limits
