## Overview

This section provides high-level technical details for developers integrating with BeatPass or interested in the platform architecture.

---

## Technology Stack

BeatPass is built on a modern web stack:

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | PHP (Laravel) |
| Frontend | React |
| Authentication | Cookie-based SPA sessions |
| Database | MySQL |
| Payments | Stripe Connect |
| Real-time | WebSocket-based push notifications |

---

## Background Job System

BeatPass uses Laravel's queue system for resource-intensive tasks that run asynchronously.

### Queue Priority Levels

| Priority | Use Case | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Real-time** | Critical user actions | Checkout completion, immediate notifications |
| **High** | Important async tasks | Email delivery, file transcoding |
| **Default** | Standard background work | Metadata extraction, analytics events |
| **Analytics** | Low-priority aggregation | Contribution calculations, leaderboard updates |

### Batched Processing

Heavy operations like contribution calculations and analytics aggregation are processed in optimized batches to prevent database strain:

- Batch sizes are dynamically adjusted based on system load
- Failed jobs are automatically retried with exponential backoff
- Critical operations are logged for audit purposes

---

## Caching Architecture

BeatPass employs a multi-layer caching strategy:

| Cache Layer | Purpose | TTL |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| **Edge Cache** | Static assets (images, audio files) | Long (days) |
| **Application Cache** | API responses, computed data | Short-medium (minutes-hours) |
| **Query Cache** | Complex database query results | Very short (seconds-minutes) |

### Cache Invalidation

Caches are invalidated using event-driven patterns:

- Track/album updates clear related caches immediately
- User profile changes trigger targeted invalidation
- Analytics caches use time-based expiration with refresh-ahead

<Note>
  When you update content via the API, relevant caches are cleared immediately so changes appear without delay.
</Note>

---

## Rate Limiting

The API uses route-specific rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

| Endpoint Group | Limit | Notes |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| Standard API calls | Global default | Laravel's built-in throttle |
| Producer Intelligence (public) | 300/min | Leaderboards, growth rates |
| Producer Intelligence (auth) | 500/min | Dashboard, analytics |
| Social Analytics | 120/min | Complex queries |
| Legacy endpoints | 60/min | Deprecated routes |

<Tip>
  If you encounter rate limits, implement exponential backoff with jitter. Check the `Retry-After` header for guidance on when to retry.
</Tip>

---

## API Design Patterns

### Authentication

All authenticated endpoints use Laravel Sanctum's cookie-based SPA authentication:

1. Get CSRF cookie: `GET /sanctum/csrf-cookie`
2. Login: `POST /login` with CSRF token
3. Make requests with session cookies (automatically handled by browsers)

See the [Authentication guide](/developers/auth) for details.

### Response Formats

API responses follow Laravel conventions:

- **Success**: Direct JSON data or wrapped in `data` key for paginated results
- **Errors**: `message` field with optional `errors` object for validation failures
- **Pagination**: Laravel's standard pagination structure with `data`, `current_page`, `total`, etc.

### Authentication Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Optional authentication | Works without auth, returns enhanced data when authenticated |
| Required authentication | Requires a valid session |
| Rate limited | Subject to request throttling |
