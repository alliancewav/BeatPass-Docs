## Overview

BeatPass uses **inbound webhooks** to receive payment notifications from Stripe. There is currently no outbound webhook system for external integrations.

<Note>
  BeatPass does not send webhooks to external applications. This page documents how BeatPass receives payment notifications from Stripe.
</Note>

## Inbound Webhooks (Stripe)

BeatPass receives webhooks from Stripe to process purchase-related payment events.

### Webhook Endpoint

```
POST /api/stripe/webhook
```

This endpoint is registered in Stripe's dashboard (and wired via `mapWebhookRoutes` and `routes/webhooks.php`) to receive all payment-related events.

Example `curl` request (replace the payload with an actual Stripe event JSON when testing):

```bash
curl -X POST https://open.beatpass.ca/api/stripe/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Stripe-Signature: <generated-signature>" \
  -d '{"type": "payment_intent.succeeded", "data": {}}'
```

## Stripe Events Handled

The webhook controller processes the following Stripe events:

### Purchase Events

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `payment_intent.succeeded` | Marks purchase as succeeded, generates exclusive license certificate, marks track as sold |
| `payment_intent.payment_failed` | Marks purchase as failed with error message |
| `charge.refunded` | Marks purchase as refunded (partial or full) |

### Stripe Connect Payout Events

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `payout.created` | Notifies producer that payout was initiated to their bank |
| `payout.paid` | Notifies producer that payout was deposited successfully |
| `payout.failed` | Notifies producer of payout failure with error reason |

### Account Events

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `account.updated` | Syncs Stripe Connect account status; notifies producer if action is required |

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Payment Initiated">
    User initiates a track purchase via Stripe.js.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Stripe Processes">
    Stripe processes the payment and updates the PaymentIntent status.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Webhook Sent">
    Stripe sends a webhook to BeatPass at `/api/stripe/webhook`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="BeatPass Processes">
    BeatPass verifies the signature and processes the event:
    - Updates purchase/payout records
    - Generates license certificates for successful purchases
    - Marks tracks as sold for exclusive purchases
    - Sends notifications to producers
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Security

### Stripe Signature Verification

All incoming Stripe webhooks are verified using the webhook signing secret:

```php
// BeatPass webhook handler (simplified)
$payload = $request->getContent();
$sigHeader = $request->header('Stripe-Signature');
$webhookSecret = config('services.stripe.webhook_secret');

$event = \Stripe\Webhook::constructEvent(
    $payload,
    $sigHeader,
    $webhookSecret
);
```

<Warning>
  Webhooks without valid Stripe signatures are rejected with a 400 response.
</Warning>

## For Developers

### Testing Webhooks Locally

Use the Stripe CLI to forward webhooks during development:

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to a local development server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/stripe/webhook

# Forward webhooks to a remote dev server (example)
stripe listen --forward-to https://dev.example.com/api/stripe/webhook
```

### Webhook Events in Stripe Dashboard

Monitor webhook delivery in the Stripe Dashboard:

1. Go to **Developers > Webhooks**
2. Select your endpoint
3. View recent events and delivery status
4. Retry failed webhooks if needed

---

## No Outbound Webhooks

<Info>
  BeatPass does not currently offer outbound webhooks for external integrations.
</Info>

For real-time updates in your application:

- **Track changes:** Poll the API or use the notifications SSE stream (authenticated)
- **Purchase status:** Use the purchase status endpoint after initiating
- **User events:** Handled client-side via the BeatPass frontend

### Future Considerations

Outbound webhooks for third-party integrations may be considered for future releases. If you have a specific use case, contact support to discuss.
