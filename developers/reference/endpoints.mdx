## OpenAPI Explorer

The API reference uses the BeatPass OpenAPI specification to provide interactive documentation for all endpoints. Browse by category in the **Endpoint Explorer** section of the navigation.

<Info>
  **Base URL:** `https://open.beatpass.ca/api/v1`
</Info>

## Using the API Explorer

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an Endpoint">
    Expand the **Endpoint Explorer** in the sidebar and choose a category:
    - **Search** — Full-text search across content
    - **Tracks** — Track listing, details, and management
    - **Artists** — Artist profiles and followers
    - **Albums** — Album management
    - **Playlists** — Playlist CRUD and collaboration
    - **License Certificates** — License generation and verification
    - And more...
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Parameters">
    Each endpoint shows required and optional parameters, request body schemas, and example values.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Try It Out">
    Use the **Try It** feature to make live API calls. Note that authenticated endpoints require a valid session (see Authentication).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Responses">
    Response schemas show the expected data structure. Error responses (401, 403, 404, 422) are documented for each endpoint.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication Note

BeatPass uses **cookie-based session authentication**, not Bearer tokens. The OpenAPI explorer's "Set authentication" feature is primarily for documentation purposes.

To make authenticated requests:

1. Authenticate via the standard login flow (see [Authentication](/developers/auth))
2. Include `credentials: 'include'` in fetch requests to send session cookies

<Warning>
  The API does not accept Bearer tokens. All authentication is handled via Sanctum session cookies.
</Warning>

## Quick Examples

### Public Endpoint (No Auth)

```bash
# Search for tracks (works without authentication)
curl "https://open.beatpass.ca/api/v1/search?query=lofi&types=track&limit=5" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### Authenticated Endpoint

```javascript
// JavaScript with session cookies
const response = await fetch('https://open.beatpass.ca/api/v1/messaging/conversations', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  },
  credentials: 'include' // Required for session cookies
});
```
